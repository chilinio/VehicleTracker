# GitHub Setup Instructions - IMPORTANT

## The Problem
When you try to push to GitHub, you're getting a "Repository not found" error because:
1. The GitHub repository doesn't exist yet
2. GitHub needs authentication to create or access the repository

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
1. Open a web browser and go to: https://github.com/new
2. Sign in to your GitHub account
3. Repository name: Enter "VehicleTracker"
4. Description: "Vehicle Maintenance Website with Admin Dashboard"
5. Select Public or Private
6. DO NOT initialize with README
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Set up Authentication
GitHub no longer accepts simple password authentication. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use Git Credential Manager (Easiest)
1. In the terminal, try running:
```
git push -u origin main
```
2. A browser window should open asking you to authenticate
3. Log in with your GitHub credentials

### Option 2: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Note: "Vehicle Tracker Access"
4. Select scopes: repo (all repo options)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when Git asks for authentication

## Step 3: Confirm Your Setup
After creating the repository:
```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/chilinio/VehicleTracker.git
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for your password, use your Personal Access Token.

## Need Help?
If you still have issues:
1. Create the GitHub repository manually through the web interface
2. Clone it to a new directory
3. Copy your files to the new directory
4. Add, commit, and push from there
